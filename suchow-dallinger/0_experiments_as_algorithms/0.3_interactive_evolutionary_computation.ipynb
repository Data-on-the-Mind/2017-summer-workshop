        "Preferences can be elicited experimentally by asking a participant to choose which of two options is preferable. For example, in psychology and behavioral economics, studies of temporal discounting ask a person to select between a small sum given now and a larger sum given later. Tw alternative forced-choice designs over all possible pairs of competing forms can find the preferred\n",

Consider for example vanity numbers, telephone numbers with a custom and often easily remembered sequence of digits (e.g., +1 202 456-1111). An algorithm that finds preferred vanity numbers by taking as input pairwise preference judgments across all valid telephone numbers is intractable. \n",

        "Interactive evolutionary computation can solve problems like finding good vanity numbers by inserting human participants into various parts of an evolutionary process. In interactive genetic algorithms, for example, a human participant may act as the selection mechanism, using aesthetic judgment to select which forms will replicate to form the next generation. In many cases, these algorithms quickly converge on preferred forms.\n",
