A common technique is to copy and paste the entire analysis pipeline into a new directory, appending a unique identifier such as `analysis_NEW` for version 2, `analysis_NEWNEW` for version 3, etc. Though it's certainly better than nothing, this tends to produce a mess of easily confusable directories (see 9 below), bloated directories, and inconsistencies when bugs are fixed in one version but not the others.\n",
        "\nInstead, use a proper version control system. As of 2017, it's worth starting with [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a standard. The learning curve is particularly shallow, so you may consider starting with an interactive training tool like [`githug`](https://github.com/Gazler/githug) that will run you through the basics quickly. A good first goal would be to learn the vocabulary: repository, clone, stage, commit, push, pull, origin, master, remote, local, merge, and rebase."
