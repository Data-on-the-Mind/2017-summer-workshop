    "One of the benefits of working within the notebook format is that the notebook can be converted to many other types of formats. This is beneficial for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we want to start prototyping in the notebook, but eventually move to a Python script, we can export the notebook to Python rather than having to copy and paste.\n",
    "2. If we want to create a static version of the notebook (e.g., to email to colleagues), we can export the notebook to HTML or PDF (though, full disclosure, exporting to PDF can sometimes be finicky---so I prefer exporting to HTML).\n",
    "3. If we want to report on our findings via a blog post, we can export the notebook to Markdown or RST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many export formats can be accessed through the notebook interface itself, by choosing **File$\\rightarrow$Download As** in the menu. We can also export to different formats by using the `jupyter nbconvert` command line tool. Using the command line tool also gives us more flexibility in terms of allowing us to specify different options and templates."
