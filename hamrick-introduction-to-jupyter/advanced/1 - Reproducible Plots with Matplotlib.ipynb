    "How should you create a plot for inclusion in a publication? A common workflow for Matlab or Python users—and one that I used to use myself—is to create a figure just using the defaults, export it as SVG, and open it Inkscape or Illustrator to make it look nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works fine if you only need to edit how a figure looks once. However, this is almost never the case. As you iterate further on the paper, your advisor may ask you to generate the plot a slightly different way. Or, perhaps, you find an off-by-one error in your code and need to regenerate the figure with the correct results. However, having to go through the whole process of re-editing your figures in a vector graphics program can take a *lot* of time, and thus this added time cost may discourage you from regenerating figures (even when you really should).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another option, albeit with a higher startup cost. If you use Python, then Matplotlib actually exposes almost all the controls you need to make instantly reproducible, beautiful figures. The high startup cost is learning how to use those controls, which can take a lot of effort. However, I'd argue that this startup cost is entirely worth it. After having used Matplotlib exclusively for my figures since starting graduate school, I can now create a fully reproducible, publication-quality figure in about 10 minutes. In this part of the tutorial, I'll walk you through the steps needed to go from Matplotlib's defaults, to something useable in a publication."

In our experiment, we had three different robot behaviors (*fixed*, *reactive*, and *predictive*), and two different ways the robot obtained information about the human's goals (*oracle*, in which the robot had perfect knowledge, and *Bayesian*, in which the robot infers the human's goals based on their motion).
